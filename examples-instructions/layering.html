		This demo shows how layering works. Basically you can display stuff in different layers so you don't have to worry about drawing order. Ofcourse there are times when drawing order is important, but layers take care of the bulk of the problem.
	</p>

	<p>
		The demo sets up three objects that display squares of different colors. If you try to add more than three objects, an error will be shown in console. It doesn't break the demo, but it lets you know that something is up.
