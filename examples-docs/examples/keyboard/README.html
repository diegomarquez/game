<p>This example will deal with the keyboard module. 
I believe that is pretty self explanatory.</p>

<p>Some notes, the keyboard module will setup some listeners to override standard browser behaviour.
You probably do not want the window to scroll when you press the arrow keys.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of defined constants, you can find them in the framework's folder in keyboard.js 
It's not all of them, but if you need more than 20 keys for a game... I don't know... maybe you are doing it wrong.</p>

<p>For reasons (I don't want to do it), only the callback for the A key makes something appear on the canvas.
If you want to see the rest of the messages, you can do so on your browser's console. 
By 'your browser' I mean Chrome.</p>

<p>If you try to create more game objects than the amount specified when creating the pools,
an error will be thrown, but that escapes the scope of this example.</p>

<p>Another example deals with recycling game objects. If you want to continue pressing 'A'
to create more boxes, refresh the example. Yeah... pretty crud, I know.</p>
