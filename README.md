# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

First thing on the TODO list:
	Make RequireJS modules out of the main files.
	This should let me handle dependancies in a clean way and keep things out of the global scope.
	
Status: Broken. This thing can not be used for anything useful and there is no documentation anyway. So it is pretty useless.

[This is the game][tirador] I put together using the previous encarnation of this set of files.
