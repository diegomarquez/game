game-framework
==============

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project, It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

First thing on the TODO list:
	Make RequireJS modules out of the main files. 
	This should let me handle dependancies in a clean way and keep things out of the global scope.
	
Status: Broken. This thing can not be used for anything useful and there is no documentation anyway. So it it pretty useless

This is the game I put together using the previous encarnation of this set of files:
