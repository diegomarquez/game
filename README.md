# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

-----------------------------------

###### Current TODO List:

- Write some example code. Should have examples for each individual aspect of the framework
  - Game Object Hierarchy
    - Basic 
    - Nesting
      - Containers
      - Layers
  - Components
    - Misc Logic
    - Collision
    - Rendering
  - Input
  - Sound
  - Timers
  - State Machine
  - Delegates
    - Overview on all the callbacks available to game_object
    - Overview on all the callbacks available to canvas_wrapper
    - Overview on all the callbacks available to component
  - Canvas Wrapper 
    - Pause & Resume
    - Extensions
  - Different ways to send in arguments to a game_object
    - Configuration Type
    - Through assembler.get
    - Through game_object.start
  - Text

- Write a README.md for each example

-----------------------------------

#### Status: Not usable.

* Right now you could use this to do something, if you could take a look inside my mind that is. 
* No documentation and no examples means it is still useless.

-----------------------------------
