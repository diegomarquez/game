# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

###### Current TODO List:

* Create a component to handle basic collision detection between game_objects
* Create a component to handle rendering of a game_object
* Setup a system to configure what components an instance of a game_object should have

#### Status: Broken. 

* This thing can not be used for anything useful and there is no documentation anyway. So it is still in a pretty useless state.

[This is the game][tirador] I put together using the previous encarnation of this set of files.
