# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

-----------------------------------

###### Current TODO List:

- Write some example code. Should have examples for each individual aspect of the framework
  - [ ] Collision
  - [ ] Components
  - [ ] Game Object Hierarchy
  - [ ] Input
  - [ ] Sound
  - [ ] Timers
  - [ ] State Machine
  - [ ] Renderer Components
  - [ ] Delegates

- Components for game.js. The user should be able to enhance the behaviour of the main update loop.

-----------------------------------

#### Status: Not usable.

* Right now you could use this to do something, if you could take a look inside my mind that is. 
* No documentation and no examples means it is still useless.

-----------------------------------

#### [This is the game][tirador] I put together using the previous encarnation of this set of files.
