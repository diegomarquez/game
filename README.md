# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

-----------------------------------

###### Current TODO List:

- Write some example code. Should have examples for each individual aspect of the framework
    * Game Object Hierarchy
        + Basic ( Done )
        + Nesting
            - Containers
            - Layers
    * Components
        + Misc Logic
        + Collision
        + Rendering
    * Input
    * Sound
    * Timers
    * State Machine
    * Delegates
        + Overview on all the callbacks available to game_object
        + Overview on all the callbacks available to canvas_wrapper
        + Overview on all the callbacks available to component
    * Canvas Wrapper 
        + Pause & Resume
        + Extensions
    * Different ways to send in arguments to a game_object
        + Configuration Type
        + Through assembler.get
        + Through game_object.start
    * Text

- Write a README.md for each example

-----------------------------------

#### Status: Not usable. Working on example code.

* Right now you could use this to do something, if you could take a look inside my mind that is. 
* Examples are in the making.
