# Game.js

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. It's kind of like a framework to make simple games, things like Asteroids or Galaga.

###### Current TODO List:

* Simple event bubbling
* Write some example code
* Components for game.js. The user should be able to enhance the behaviour of the main update loop.

#### Status: Broken.

* This thing can not be used for anything useful and there is no documentation anyway. So it is still in a pretty useless state.

[This is the game][tirador] I put together using the previous encarnation of this set of files.
