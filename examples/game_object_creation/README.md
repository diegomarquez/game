##### New things that are happening here

* main.js

```javascript
gjs.setModulePath('basic_bundle');
```

Again the **gjs global object**

Think of this line as an import in JAVA, you will need to add this to require custom modules
not included by default in bootstrap.js. In reality you don't need to add these kind of lines,
but if you don't, you have to type in the whole relative path in each require call. And that is not very nice.

Hopefully you won't need to care about this lines, because they will be autogenerated in some way.

**********

```javascript
require('basic_bundle').create();  
```
This kind of calls create an object who has only one purpose, setup the pools of objects which we would
like to use in our application. 

[The bundle file is here][bundles]. The README.md file in there will have some more information about what is going on inside these type of files.

[The specific bundle file used in this example][bundle]

*NOTE: Technically you don't need to use this objects, you could just take the code that is in them and slap it in here, but I think it looks nicer this way. You might even want to reuse that code later on.*

**********

```javascript
//The ID "Base_1" is defined in basic_bundle.js
var go = gjs.assembler.get('Base_1');
```

The **assembler** module which can be found in the **gjs global object** takes care of building the type of game object that was specified during the configuration of the pools of objects. By this point
you should really go take a look at [the bundle file used][bundle] if you are interested in understanding what is going on.

**********

```javascript
//Adding the game_object to a layer. 
gjs.layers.get('Middle').add(go);
```

The **layers** module which can be found in the **gjs global object** is the main container for everything that gets updated and/or rendered. What is going on in this line is that we are asking for the 'Middle' layer and then adding our newly assembled game object into it.

**********

```javascript
//Until this method is called, the game_object will do nothing.
go.start();
```

Although the game object has already been added to a layer, it won't do anything until you call the start method. No logic, no rendering no nothing.
